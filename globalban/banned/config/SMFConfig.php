  *  SMF Specific Integration.  These are ignored if the $generic variable above

  *
  *  The following groups can ban, however the limited User Group can initiate a ban
  *  but it can not become activated until a Ban Manager Approves the Ban.  The Admin
  *  Group is the group of users that have full admin right and can ban who ever they
  *  please when ever they want but can only modify their own bans.  The Ban Manager
  *  group consists of people that can approve a 'limited user's' ban, however
  *  they can also enable or diable a ban completely and are able to change
  *  ny bans at their whim.
