    * 07/05/2008 - v3.4

          o GlobanBan works with the orangebox now.
          o Servers can now be grouped together with server groups. This allows you to apply 1 list of admins to multiple servers.
          o Admin Groups are now implemented. You can specify GlobalBan, Mani, and SourceMod powers within a group. You then can set an admin to this group. Click on the admins icon on the Server Page to edit their powers.
          o A new Bad Name list has been added. Any names that contain the bad name will be auto-kicked. For example, you can add myg0t to have anyone that connects with that tag to be kicked.
          o New script command gb_consoleBanUser allows a scripter to use this command to autoban. This lets GlobalBan know it was done by a script rather than an admin. Refer to GlobalBan.py to see an example.
          o Mani and SourceMod support is in place. If you plan to use it, you must disable Mani's database usage. The same is true for SourceMod. GlobalBan writes the admins lists to flat files. Please be sure to backup those files before using GlobalBan to manage your lists.
